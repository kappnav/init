# Note this service must be created before the kappnav-ui deployment so
# that secret kappnav-ui-service-tls (see annotation, below) can be created
# first, since it will be mounted to the kappnav-ui pod.  If you create
# them at or near the same time the race condition fails to setup the 
# secret in time to be mounted on the pod and the pod fails.
